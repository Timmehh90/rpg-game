# Dragon Repeller

## Overview

I am following the **javascript algorithms and data structures v8** course on freeCodeCamp.org
This is the first project called _Dragon Repeller_.
I am to make a small rpg game with html, css and javascript.

## What I've Learned

- I've learned the benefits of having arrays for the first time. Before i knew
  their existence, but not their advantages.
- I have worked with array method .length extensively and understand that this is
  a powerful method to use in a for loop to iterate over an array.
- _Math.floor()_ will round a number to an integer.
- _Math.random() \* num_ will pick a random number from 0 till num minus 1.
- It's better to bold a text within an element using "strong, /strong" instead of
  using "span class='bold', /span".
